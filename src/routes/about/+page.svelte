			<h3 class="text-2xl text-white mb-2">TL;DR of my life</h3>
			<p>
				I loved exploring tech every since I was a kid, having taken apart (read: broken) a
				telephone at the age of 6, made an LED torch at 7, and started fiddling with HTML/CSS/JS at
				8.
				<br />
				Although my first proper experience with programming was at the age of 11, when I created my
				first Android app, with code shamelessly stolen from StackOverflow. And got my first soldering
				iron burn at the age of 12, when I frankenstein'd two broken phones to make a (questionably)
				working one.
				<br />
				Nowadays my life involves opening a beer can and bashing on the keyboard until the pixels on
				the screen change in a way I like.

			<h3 class="text-2xl text-white mb-2">Interests</h3>
			<p>I am interested in a lot of things, let's make a list:</p>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
				<li>
					<b>Space</b> was something I was interested in since forever, and I really want to go to space
					someday. For now, I participated and won a few astronomy olympiads and competitions, got a
					telescope of my own to stare at the sky and am currently trying to figure out radio astronomy.
				</li>
				<li>
					I love reading about <b>STEM</b> topics, although mostly excluding the "M" in STEM (I don't
					like pure maths; I am an engineer).
				</li>
				<li>
					I have been watching/reading <b>anime & manga</b> since a long time now. It's my favorite form
					of entertainment, and for a variety of reasons, I prefer them over other forms of entertainment.
				</li>
				<li>
					And of course, I am a <b>gamer</b>, been playing games ever since I got to use my first
					PC.
				</li>
				<li>
					Can't leave out <b>programming</b>, after all, it's what I do both for a living and as a
					hobby.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ofcourse, that includes <b>hacking</b> too! Both hardware and software hacking, including but
					not limited to RF-snooping, CTFs, reverse engineering, etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
